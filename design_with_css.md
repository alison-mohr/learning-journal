# Design Webpages with CSS

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. CSS allows the web developer to apply specific rules to different HTML elements.

## Duckett: HTML & CSS, Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS
- CSS rules are typically listed in a separate style sheet 
- Rules are made of selectors and declarations 
  - Selectors specify the elements the rule applies to
  - Declarations indicate what the elements should look like 
- There are different types of selectors to specify the different features of elements 
- Declarations have two parts: properties of the element and the value of the property

## Duckett: HTML & CSS, Chapter 11 - Color
- You can specify color using hex codes, RGB values, and color names 
- When using color, ensure that there is enough contrast between the text and the background in order for the element to be readable 
- RGBA adds a fourth value to RGB to indicate opacity 
- HSLA adds a fourth value to HSL to indicate opacity
