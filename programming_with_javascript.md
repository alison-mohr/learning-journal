# Programming with JavaScript 

## Scripts - Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Introduction and Chapter 1a, pages 1-24
- A script is made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step
- Scripts can run different sections of a code in response to an event happening around them 

  ### Steps to Write Script
  1. Define the Goal 
  2. Design the Script 
  3. Code Each Step 
 
 ## Expressions & Operators - Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Chapter 2, pages 74-79
 - Expressions evaluate a single value. There are two types: 
    1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable (var color = 'beige')
    2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value   (var area = 3*2) 
 - Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values 
 
 ## Functions - Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Chapter 2, pages 88-94
 - Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task
 - You can reuse a function if parts of the script repeat the same task 
 - To create function, include the steps below: 
   1. Declare the function: Give it a name and then write the function needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces 
   2. Call the function: Executes all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code
   3. Declare functions that need information: Provide additional information (parameters) needed to help the function perform its task
        - Parameters act like variables 
   4. Call functions that need information: Specify the values (arguments) the functions should used in the parentheses that follow its name
    5. Get a single value out of a function: Some functions return information to the code that called them
