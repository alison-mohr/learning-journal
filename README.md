# About Me
Hi! I am Alison Mohr. I recently joined the K-12 Education team at NewBoCo and am excited to start supporting students, teachers, and families with computer science education. I have taught for the past ten years as an elementary teacher and middle school STEM teacher. I have been a facilitator for the Code.org Computer Science course for the past two years and enjoy helping teachers learn about computer science. My husband, son (4), daughter (2), and I live in Altoona and enjoy being outside and traveling.
