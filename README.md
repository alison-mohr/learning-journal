# About Me
Hi! I am Alison Mohr. I recently joined the K-12 Education team at NewBoCo and am excited to start supporting students, teachers, and families with computer science education. I have taught for the past ten years as an elementary teacher and middle school STEM teacher. I have been a facilitator for the Code.org Computer Science course for the past two years and enjoy helping teachers learn about computer science. My husband, son (4), daughter (2), and I live in Altoona and enjoy being outside and traveling. 

## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is a belief that we can *improve our abilities* with additional learning, practice, and perserverance. Growth mindset believes that challenges are opportunities to grow and should be embraced. Areas that I need to focus on to have a growth mindset are: 
1. Set goals and work to meet them. Monitor my progress!
2. Look for criticism to help me grow, but always take time to consider what things went right. 
3. If something doesn't work, take a step back and regroup instead of getting frustrated
