# The Coder's Computer 

In the first assignment, I installed multiple programs (VS Code, Git, Node, NPM, ESLint) to prepare to code. I also accessed my computer's terminal or the first time. Programs used include: 

* Text Editor: a piece of software that allows you to build a website. 
* VS Code: Text editor we will use for coding 
* Homebrew: Installed for Mac OS. Installed through the system's terminal
* ESLint: Tool to help identify problems in JavaScript 
* Node and NPM: Node allows developers to write in JavaScript. NPM works within Node and allows access to install programs 
* Git: Version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people
