# Computer Architecture and Logic

For this journal entry, I used [videos from Code.org](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) to expand my learning on computers. 

## What is a Computer? 
Computers contain four main parts: input, output, processing, and storage

## How Computers Work  
- Bit = the most simple form of binary that displays information as true/false or 0/1 
- Binary is a string of bits that is used to represent information in a computer
- Billions of pieces of information, images, videos, and sound can be represented with binary 

## Circuits & Data 
- Takes information and processes it
- More sophisticated cirtcuits can combine different pieces of information 
- Computers use a combination of millions of circuits to process input signals
