# Operators and Loops

## Comparison and Logical Operators - Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Chapter 4, pages 150-151, 156, and 157
- Comparison operators are used to evaluate two values
- Results is a Boolean statement (true or false)
- Usually return single values of true or false

### Operators: 
- Is equal to: == or ===
- Is not equal to !=
- Greater than [or equal to]: or >=
- Less than [or equal to]: < or <=

Logical operators can be used to compare the results of more than one comparison operator
- AND (tests more than one condition): &&
- OR (tests at least one condition): ||
- NOT (inverts boolean value): !

Example logical operator:   `((5 < 2) && (2>= 3))`
- operator compares the two conditions to be true or false

### Short-Circuit Operators 
- Logical expressions are evalued left to right
- If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition 


## Loops - Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Chapter 4, pages 170-173, and 176
- Loops check for a condition
- If the condition is true, a code block will  run 
- Loop will continue to check the condition and run until the condition returns false 
  * For Loops: Allows you to set the number of times you need the loop to run 
  * While: Condition can be set fo rthe code to continue to loop for as long as the condition is true
  * Do... while Loop: Similar to the while loop, but always runs the statements inside the curly braces at least once
