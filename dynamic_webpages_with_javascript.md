- JavaScript is stored in it's own file with the .js extension 
- <script> is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file 
- When viewing the source code, it will appear that nothing has changed if a JavaScript command is used. However, when the live version is used, it will be a more dynamic and interactive version
- Parameters can be used for pieces of data to send the method for processing
