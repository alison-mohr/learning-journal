## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is a belief that we can *improve our abilities* with additional learning, practice, and perserverance. Growth mindset believes that challenges are opportunities to grow and should be embraced. Areas that I need to focus on to have a growth mindset are: 
1. Set goals and work to meet them. Monitor my progress!
2. Look for criticism to help me grow, but always take time to consider what things went right. 
3. If something doesn't work, take a step back and regroup instead of getting frustrated.
