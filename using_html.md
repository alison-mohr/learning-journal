# Structure Webpages with HTML 

## Duckett: Chapter 18 - Process & Design 
* Lots of great tips and information about designing the structure of your website to make it user friendly 
* When designing, consider the target audience and why they would use your site
* Create a site map to layout the elements of your site and plan the structure 
* Wireframes allow the web developer to organize information for each page 
* Use visual hierarchy to help users understand the information 
* Color, size, and style are all ways to differentiate between information 
* Grouping structures can simplify and intentionally group related information 

## Duckett:Chapter 1 - Structure 
* HTML pages are text documents that use tags to designate specific meaning of elements 
* Tags are often referred to as elements 
* Tags are usually paired. Opening tag <p> is placed at the beginning of the content; the closing tag </p> shows the end 
* Opening tags include attributes, which tell us information about the content of the element 
* Attributes require a name and value 
* To use HTML, the web developer needs to understand the different types fo tags and where to use them 

## Duckett: Chapter 17 - HTML5 Layout 
* New HTML5 elements help web developers structure different parts of a webpage and describe its structure
* Previously the <div> was used to nest elements 
* New structure makes it clearer to read 
* Header, nav, main, article, section, aside, and footer elements are examples of HTML5 elements

## Duckett: Chapter 8 - Extra Markup
* <!DOCTYPE html> tells browsers which version of HTML you are using 
* <!--   comment ---> allows you to add comments to your code 
* id and class attributes - identifies particular elements 
* <div> and <span> elements - group block-level and inline elements together 
* <iframes> displays other windows into your web pages (embed calendar, video, doc, etc.)
* <meta> allows you to supply information about your web page 
* &lt  and &gt  are used for < and > 
* &copy is used for the copyright symbol
